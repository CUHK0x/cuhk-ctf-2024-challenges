## Description
Wait a minute, this file does not look right. Let me just remove all the files and start again:
```
rm -rf *
```
Press Enter, and... [oh, no](https://youtu.be/X6NJkWbM1xk?si=opFBm424Z4qqFaXP).

And on that disappointment, after I accidentally deleted my super secret stash, I panicked and went ahead to shrink my whole hard drive into a file with Doraemon's minifying torch. ~Hunting treasures with my overpowered forensics skill~

*To refer to this challenge without sounding like a Japanese light novel author, you can use the name `dorafile`. It does not even look the same to the original title, so sorry for my terrible naming skills.*

First, get verified in the server in #verify.

Next, after some analysis in the server, you can see that in #mod channel, there is a button which can become a trial moderator. Click that button to get trial moderator.

You now see #mod-chat channel, but the flag doesn't exist. Because the flag is not in there.

If you play around the server for awhile to see if there are any differences after getting trial moderator role, you can see that you can now add roles for yourself.

Try to add all roles for yourself and the #secret-channel reveals.

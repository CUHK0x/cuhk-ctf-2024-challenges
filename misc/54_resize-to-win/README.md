## Description
chinese University of Hong Kong CTF is an event by
university where everyone competes. Oh, it, weirdly,  
has flag RegEx which made challenge less guessy. We're
kind isn't it? I will annouce it later. This CTF is held in 
2024, a favorable year for CTF. Each team can have <=
4 members only. Anyways, why do we hold this event? 
chinese University of Hong Kong made these contests
to raise awareness of cybersecurity. Now, I'll annouce
flag format, which is the beautiful `cuhk24ctf{.+}`. Note:
`{` is the 10-th character. I told you I'm nice. Btw, it's an
long 48-hour contest attempting to raise knowledges
on things related to cybersecurity. Hopefully after this,
new chapter of Hong Kong can be initiated. In fact, it's
good to know you can join this event. In particular, it's
superior to know more cybersecurity things, because
the amount of cybercriminals are increasing; we are
oblivious about them, however. In order to solve this,
raising awareness by CTF is important. Actually, this
year, we have 5 main categories: crypto, web, forens
and rev and pwn. These categories are the utimately
cores of cybersecurity. Web contains SQL injections,
remote code execution, file upload bypass, XSS attack,
oS command injection and even more. Forensics has
steganography, network packet analysis etc. Pwn has
too much to talk so I will skip. Reverse engineering has
inspection of assembly code. Last but not least, we have
crypto. It has cryptography algos. Lastly, I hint you that
`}` is the last character of the flag. X Chinese statement.

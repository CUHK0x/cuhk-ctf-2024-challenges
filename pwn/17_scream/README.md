## Description
First you have learned procedural programming, which is a type of imperative programming. And then there comes *Object-Oriented Programming*, a.k.a. **OOP**, where you treat everything as an object. But still people think it's not elegant enough, so Haskell came by, bringing along the glorious idea of *functional programming*, where all code has no side effects and you can write code as beautifully as mathematical statements. Now I assumed you learned how to `pwn`, and you will have heard of *Return-Oriented programming*. I looked up *sth*-oriented programming, and Google said there is *Aspect-oriented programming*, *Data-oriented programming*, and even *Railway-oriented programming*, god knows what those are.

All these programming buzzwords are good and all, but have you heard of ~~printf~~ *Scream-oriented programming*? I heard the louder you scream, the more sophisticated your scream, the more the computer will obey your instructions! You program your computer based on the high level abstract art of screaming beautifully. According to AI:
> Scream-oriented programming (SOP) is a humorous take on programming paradigms, often used to describe a style of coding where developers express their frustration or confusion through exaggerated vocalizations or "screams." It's not an official programming methodology but rather a tongue-in-cheek critique of the challenges faced in software development.

> Key Characteristics of Scream-Oriented Programming:

> Frustration Expression: Developers may feel compelled to vocalize their frustrations when encountering bugs, unclear documentation, or complex code. This is meant to be a lighthearted acknowledgment of the stress that coding can sometimes bring.

> Simplicity vs. Complexity: SOP highlights the contrast between straightforward solutions and the complexities that arise in programming. It emphasizes how sometimes simple tasks can lead to unexpected challenges.

> Community and Humor: The term plays into the culture of programming communities where sharing experiences, including struggles and frustrations, is common. Humor is often used as a coping mechanism in tech spaces.

> Not a Serious Paradigm: Unlike established programming paradigms like object-oriented or functional programming, SOP is not meant to be taken seriously. It serves as a reminder that programming can be a challenging endeavor, and it's okay to express those challenges, sometimes humorously.

> Conclusion

> While scream-oriented programming is not a recognized methodology in the software development world, it resonates with many developers who encounter the ups and downs of coding. It serves as a reminder that humor and community can help in coping with the stresses of programming.

So here's a tip: Try yelling at the computer, like **pwners** usually do. **AAAAAAAAA...**, amirite?

*pls let me bs a bit, I spent too much time on this*

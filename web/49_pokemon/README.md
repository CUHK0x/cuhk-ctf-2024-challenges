## Description
I found that there are infiltrators on this pokemon comparator website! They secretly added Flagmon (a new digimon OC) somewhere in their serivce... I obtained the passcode `dish-percent-drop-brief` from their source code, but by the time I tried to download their source code, they have already removed it... Can you help me and find Flagmon? You will be rewarded with a flag once you have found it.
